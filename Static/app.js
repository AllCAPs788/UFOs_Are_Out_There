/*Use a date form in your HTML document 
and write JavaScript code that will listen for events 
and search through the date/time column to find rows 
that match user input.*/

//better example from Day 3
let tbody = d3.select("tbody");
let tableData = data;

console.log(data);
//only prints 

// Clear the value from the text box
d3.event.target.value = "";


    }
