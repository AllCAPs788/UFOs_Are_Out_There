## About Us

Aliens-R-Real is an organization devoted to ensuring the protection of this planet through vigilance for extraterrestrial lifeforms. We seek to dispell the myth of cute, cuddly aliens who want to be our friends. It will take much in the way of trust before we can open our species to the potential threat of alien invasion.
